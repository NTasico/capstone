# Capstone Project Ideas

I will discuss my three project ideas here and describe the variables included in each data set. 

## 1. Right-wing Authoritarianism Scale (RWAS)

This data set presents the results of over one million people who have taken the RWAS test online. 
...
The dataset can answer multiple questions about those with extreme political views, especially of people who are "right-wing". We can discover various characteristics and personality traits of such group. 

### Potential Client(s)

Some thinktanks and social science organizations might find interest in such information. An example client would be the Pew Research Center, highly known for collecting and analyzing data pertaining to human beings. 

### Source of Data

Data set: http://openpsychometrics.org/_rawdata/RWAS.zip

## 2. National Comorbidity Survey (NCS) Series

There is an increasing rate of suicide incidents in the United States over the past several years. 

### Potential Clients

Health organizations would find this information helpful in terms of mortality rate caused by mental illnesses. 

### Source of Data

The data is extracted from the ICPSR of University of Michigan. The website contains a cohort of social science data sets.
