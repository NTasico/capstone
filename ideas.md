# Capstone Project Ideas

I will discuss my three project ideas here and describe the variables included in each data set. 

## 1. Right-wing Authoritarianism Scale (RWAS)

This data set presents the results of over one million people who have taken the RWAS test online. 
...
The dataset can answer multiple questions about those with extreme political views, especially of those who consider themselves "right-wing". We can discover various characteristics and personality traits of such group. 

### Potential Client(s)

Some thinktanks and social science organizations might find interest in such information. An example client would be the Pew Research Center, and they are highly known for collecting and analyzing data pertaining to human beings.
