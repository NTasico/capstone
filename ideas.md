# Capstone Project Ideas

I will discuss my three project ideas here and describe the variables included in each data set. TBC

## 1. Right-wing Authoritarianism Scale (RWAS)

This data set presents the results of over one million people who have taken the RWAS test online. 

...

The dataset can answer multiple questions about those with extreme political views, especially of people who are "right-wing". We can discover various characteristics and personality traits of such group.

## 2. National Comorbidity Survey (NCS) Series

There is an increasing rate of suicide incidents in the United States over the past several years. TBC

### Potential Client(s)

Health organizations would find this information helpful in terms of mortality rate caused by mental illnesses. TBC
